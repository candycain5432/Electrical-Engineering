**Tips:**  
- Start with beginner projects to understand **basic components and coding**.  
- Intermediate projects combine multiple components and teach **PWM, sensors, and displays**.  
- Advanced projects are more creative and **hardware-focused**, great for experimentation and learning safe hardware hacking techniques.
